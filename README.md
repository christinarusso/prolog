**"Your Personal Data Pod That Actually Understands You"**

Tim Berners-Lee envisioned data pods where you control your personal data. But what if your pod could also *reason* about that data intelligently?

**The Vision**: A Prolog-powered data pod on the Internet Computer that doesn't just store your data—it understands the relationships within it and can make intelligent inferences.

**How It Works**: Your pod contains facts about you in Prolog format:

- `lives_in(user, london)`
- `interested_in(user, ai)`
- `friends_with(user, alice)`
- `visited(user, paris, "2024-03-15")`

Plus rules that define your preferences and privacy logic:

- `share_location(App) :- trusted_app(App), emergency_contact(App)`
- `recommend_event(Event) :- interested_in(user, Topic), about(Event, Topic), nearby(Event)`

**The Power**:

- **Smart Privacy**: "Only share my health data with apps IF they're medical AND I've explicitly consented AND the data is anonymized"
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Your pod reasons about your interests, location, and social graph to suggest relevant content—without external algorithms profiling you
- **Contextual Sharing**: Automatically determine what data to share based on logical rules you've defined
- **Cross-Pod Reasoning**: Pods can collaborate on queries while preserving privacy: "Find friends of friends who like hiking and live nearby"

**Why IC?**: True decentralization, your rules execute in a tamper-proof environment, and reverse gas means your pod runs continuously without draining your wallet.

**The Result**: Personal data sovereignty with AI-level intelligence, but the AI is *yours* and follows *your* logical rules.

*"It's not just your data—it's your data that thinks."*
